## Overview:

The ResponsiveImageBundle adds the ability to easily create styled and responsive images (scaled, cropped, greyscale) in Symfony3.
Responsive images are generated as &lt;picture> tags or as &lt;mg> tags with sizes and scrset attributes. 

A crop and focus area widget is also provided to ensure that cropped images always include the most important part of the image.

The bundle uses [FlySystem](http://flysystem.thephpleague.com/) filesystem abstraction layer giving you control over where images are stored.
Events are used to drive the system, giving more flexibiltiy and the ability to implement queuing of intensive image processing. 

## Features

- Image objects are stored via Doctrine ORM
- Handles uploading images to a "[FlySystem](http://flysystem.thephpleague.com/)" filesystem 
- Images styles are defined in configuration.
- Breakpoints and pictures sets are defined in configuration
- Handles creation of styled images on the fly (as they are viewed) if using a local filesystem
- Includes a widget to define an image's crop and focus areas giving art direction to styled images

## Quick and basic setup

Out of the box, ResponsiveImage bundle should work with minimal configuration.

### Step 1: Download, enable the bundle and import its services and configuration

Download with composer
```
composer require irishdan/responsive-image-bundle
```
Enable the bundle and OneupFlysystem in the kernel
```php
// app/AppKernel.php

public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = array(
        // ...
        new IrishDan\ResponsiveImageBundle\ResponsiveImageBundle(),
        new Oneup\FlysystemBundle\OneupFlysystemBundle(),
    );
}
```

### Step 2: Import its services, default configuration and the local image routing

Import responsive image services, default and filesystem configuration.
```
imports:
    - { resource: "@ResponsiveImageBundle/Resources/config/services.yml" }
    - { resource: "@ResponsiveImageBundle/Resources/config/config.responsive_image_defaults.yml" }
    - { resource: "@ResponsiveImageBundle/Resources/config/config.responsive_image_filesystem.yml" }
```

Import the routing for local on the fly image generation.

```yml
responsive_image:
    resource: "@ResponsiveImageBundle/Resources/config/routing.yml"
    prefix:   /
```

### Step 3: [Install](Resources/doc/installation.md) the bundle and [generate](Resources/doc/commands.md) a [ResponsiveImage entity](Resources/doc/entities.md) and it's CRUD.

```php
php bin/console responsive_image:generate:entity
php bin/console responsive_image:generate:crud
```
With the generated image [entity](Resources/doc/entities.md) and CRUD you can now, create and [upload](Resources/doc/uploading.md) images, apply '[art direction](Resources/doc/art-direction.md)' to images.

### Step 4: Define some image styles in your [configuration](Resources/doc/configuration.md) file. (Usually config.yml)

```yml
responsive_image:
    image_styles:
        groovy_thumbnail_style:
            effect: crop
            width: 180
            height: 180
        groovy_thumbnail_style_base:
            effect: scale
            width: 240
        groovy_thumbnail_style_mobile:
            effect: scale
            height:480
        groovy_thumbnail_style_tablet:
            effect: crop
            width: 200
            height: 300
            greyscale: true

```
You can now [render](Resources/doc/rendering.md) a styled in your twig template like so:
 ```
    {{ styled_image(image, 'groovy_thumbnail_style') }}

 ```
### Step 5: Define some breakpoints and "picture sets"

```yml
breakpoints:
    base: 
        media_query: 'min-width: 0px'
    mobile: 
        media_query: 'min-width: 300px'
    desktop: 
        media_query: 'min-width: 1100px'
    groovey_picture_set:
        fallback: 'groovy_thumbnail_style'
        sources:
            base: groovy_thumbnail_style_base
            mobile: groovy_thumbnail_style_mobile
            desktop: groovy_thumbnail_style_desktop

```
You can now render &lt;picture> [responsive images](Resources/doc/rendering.md) or render [responsive background image css](Resources/doc/rendering.md) in twig templates

```
<head>
    {{ background_responsive_image(image, 'picture_set_name', '#header') }}
</head>
<body>
    {{ picture_image(image, 'groovey_picture_set') }}
</body>
```

### Step 6: Define some size sets

```yml
responsive_image:
    size_sets:
        blog_sizes:
            fallback: 'groovy_thumbnail_style_base'
            sizes:
                10vw:
                    breakpoint: 'mobile'
            srcsets: [ 'groovy_thumbnail_style_mobile', 'groovy_thumbnail_style_desktop' ]

```
You can now render &lt;img> [responsive images](Resources/doc/rendering.md) width srcset and sizes attributes in twig templates.

```
    {{ sizes_image(image, 'blog_sizes') }}
```
